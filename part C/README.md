 ## Secure computing:
<br> • Install SEAL library. Benchmark its basic operations. </br>
<br> • Implements over encrypted data soft decision tree prediction (optional: and training) protocol;</br> <br>protocol specified in Akavia et al ECML’2020 (paper available in Moodle) </br>
<br> • Optimization: batched prediction </br>
<br> • Benchmark performance for time & accuracy </br>
<br> • Extra credit: reach better performance that paper; most importantly for training. </br>
